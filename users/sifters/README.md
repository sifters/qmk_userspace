# Userspace Customizations

This includes templates and macro specifications for keymaps.
Template files (sendstring\_template.c / sendstring\_template.h)
can be copied to a new filename (sftr_macros.c/sftr_macros.h) and modified
as needed.  The __rules.mk__ needs to be modified to include 
the new files by modifying the SRC+= line.
